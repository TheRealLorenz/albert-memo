# Albert-memo
Simple python extension for [albert](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert) launcher that allows you to organize a little memo, with dates.

# Installation
Just clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/TheRealLorenz/albert-memo.git

And run the ./install.sh script:

    cd albert-memo
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh

Albert will most likely crash, so restart it.

After that go to Settings > Extensions > Python and enable the 'Memo' module
